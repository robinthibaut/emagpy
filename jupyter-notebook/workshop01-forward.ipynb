    "# Forward modelling with EMagPy\n",
    "This notebook aims at presenting the Python API of the EMagPy project (https://gitlab.com/hkex/emagpy). The Python API is the working core of EMagPy and is what the GUI is calling for processing the data. The advantage of the Python API over the GUI is that is allows more automated task to be written but also interactive execution in a jupyter notebook.\n",

From experience, the cumulative sensitvity function performs well when devices are operated at ground level in low conductivity environments.\n",
